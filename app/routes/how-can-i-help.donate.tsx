              looking to create major change for good can all make a useful contribution to

              The AI safety field is funding-limited as of late 2024, and there are important
              avenues in AI alignment research and AI governance that cannot currently be explored
              due to this lack of funding.

            If you have insights into the key obstacles or opportunities that could make a big
            difference, we encourage you to directly fund research, projects, or other expenses
            (like a plane ticket to a conference) for impactful individuals or small organizations.
          </p>
          <p>
            Donating directly bypasses traditional grantmaking, providing immediate impact and
            allowing you to share valuable insights. It diversifies funding sources, reduces
            reliance on large donors, and supports those who may otherwise face a lengthy grant
            application process.

            Direct donations to larger organizations are less common, as grantmakers typically have
            a comprehensive understanding of the major players in this space and are often
            well-positioned to make informed funding decisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, if there is a specific organization you believe is doing exceptional work and
            would benefit from additional funds, contributing directly can still be a great choice.
